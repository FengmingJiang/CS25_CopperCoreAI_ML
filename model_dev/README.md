# Model Development Overview

This directory contains the full machine learning development workflow for the **CopperCore AI** project, including:

- Sample construction and geospatial feature extraction  
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation and prediction export  

All Jupyter notebooks document the experimental process.  
Final production-ready model functions are encapsulated in the `scripts/` folder for backend integration.
